					<p><b><font size="3" face="verdana">As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” 

					In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. 
	
					How is Hyper-automation Different from Regular Automation?

					When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically advanced tools and combines them to create a new way to work. 

					It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced automatically and run efficiently with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making.

					<p><b><font size="3" face="verdana">In a competitive market, brands make continuous modernization its priority. Because, if you are not trending, nobody is going to hold on to you. Even a single bad experience can cost tons to your name.

					This is why enterprises that want to strengthen their digital experience are now looking for solutions to streamline their user’s experience across multiple platforms. Despite web browsers continuing to be the most popular touchpoint, an immersive range of devices that serves multi-experience like smartwatches, smartphones, and voice-driven devices permeate the industry. Claiming that the modes of interaction are expanding across the digital user journey.Multi-experience development platforms (MXDPs) help enterprises to rapidly scale their applications across a range of devices and platforms. MXDPs can help you develop a single application that can be deployed on a variety of devices. This greatly shortens down your efforts and gives brands more control over their digital experiences.

				<h1><a href="file:///C:/Users/jmurp/OneDrive/Html/NEW%20PROJECT%20IVAN/AboutConsultancy.html">Distributed Cloud</a><h1>
					<p><font size="3" face="verdana">
	Industry experts believe that together, edge computing and distributed cloud improve the user experience of a network. While these technologies are related, they are distinct and unique.
            Edge computing refers to computing happening at the edge of a network. Various access points define the network edge, hence the name for its architectural standard, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). Edge access points include cell phone towers, routers, WiFi, and local data centers.
                    A distributed cloud refers to having computation, storage, and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud. Examples of a distributed cloud include both fog computing and edge computing. Establishing a distributed cloud situates computing closer to the end user, providing decreased latency and opportunities for increased security. Potential security solutions include a blockchain-based security architecture or random auditing of data to check for integrity. A distributed cloud also processes data in real-time.
